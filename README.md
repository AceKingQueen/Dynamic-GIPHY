# Hollywood GIF-maker
Here I am calling the GIPHY API and using JavaScript along with jQuery to change the HTML of the site.

To see it in action, click on the "Meryl Streep" button. You will see 10 Meryl Streep-themed GIFs generated. Click on the GIF for it to play. Clicking again on the GIF will pause it. 

You can can also create a new button with a new actor, movie title, or movie character of your choosing. Type your choice in and add it using the button. Then click on your newly-generated button and voila!
